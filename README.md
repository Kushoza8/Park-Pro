  <h1><b>PARK_PRO: QR-Based Box Parking Management System</b></h1>
</div>

---

### üìú **Project Overview**
The **PARK_PRO** system is a web interface designed to address the common issue of blocked parking, particularly in scenarios known as "box parking." Box parking occurs when a vehicle is parked in such a way that it blocks other vehicles from exiting their parking space, leading to significant inconvenience for other drivers.

### üõ†Ô∏è **How It Works**

#### 1. **User Registration**
Vehicle owners must first register on our portal by creating an account and providing essential details, such as their vehicle registration number, contact information, and other required personal information.

</div>

After successful registration, the system generates a unique QR code for each user, linked to their vehicle's registration number.

#### 2. **QR Code Generation and Application**
Upon registration, a unique QR code is generated. This QR code must be printed and affixed to the vehicle in a visible location, such as the windshield or rear window. This code serves as a digital identifier, making it easy for others to contact the vehicle owner if their car is blocking access.

#### 3. **Blocked Vehicle Scenario**
If a user's vehicle is blocked by another, they can scan the QR code on the blocking vehicle using their smartphone. Upon scanning, they are redirected to a user-friendly interface with predefined options to either send a message or place a call to the vehicle owner. This quick process helps resolve the issue efficiently.

Additionally, users may be prompted to enter the vehicle registration number for confirmation.
